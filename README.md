# Monetivo WooCommerce Plugin

## Basic information

This repository has been created solely for development purposes. If you are a developer and want to help (great!) then follow the instructions below.
If you just wanted to install this plugin but got lost, visit plugin subpage on the Official Wordpress Plugins Site <url> and follow published steps.

## Development

You can build a development environment by yourself using `docker` and `docker-compose`. Assuming you have installed both tools, open `docker-compose.php56apache.yml` in some editor
and set the desired plugins versions. Then just run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.php56apache.yml up` in terminal. Docker will download proper images and plugins for you automatically. You will find the installation files in `source` folder.
